    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: white;" class="gfg">I've started this website to see if it feels right to me to do this. The truth is that with the little time that I have, I see some evolution. I only started exploring tech a few weeks ago, with the aid of my sister-in-law, and to be honest, I'm enjoying this completely new world. Everything is new to me, but as a curious person, I'll manage to find a way. My sister-in-law said, "Look back a few weeks and try to imagine if you could do what you do now." <br>That phrase will be engraved in my mind from now on. <br>When I make some significant advance, I'll be updating this column with some info. From now on, I'm just happy with my little achievements.</p>

  <div class="column2" style="height: 300px;border-style: none;">
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">At the bottom, any curious visitor can find a summary of my twelve years as a worker in a plant, building catalysts, bending pipes, making exhaust systems, being a team leader, welding in MIG/TIG, and so on.

  <h2>2010/2015</h2>
  <p>My journey started in 2010, when I was 19 years old. I didn't have any experience working, but started working in a factory, first as an assembler, but in a matter of months I started welding in the MIG/TIG process. Most of my time spent in that plant was welding catalysts on the night shift.</p>
</div>

<div id="b2" class="containerTab" style="display:none;background:#676765">
  <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="closebtn">x</span>
  <h2>2015/2020</h2>
  <p>I've moved to the cold part of my plant and needed to adapt to a completely different environment. Instead of manual welding and robots, I was in a part of the plant where the benders came in, mostly Crippa. Huge machines that bend and cut pipe. I took my first steps with some G-code and started working as a team leader. It was a big change and some of the best years in that plant, and I worked four years on the day shift in this timeline.</p>
</div>

<div id="b3" class="containerTab" style="display:none;background:#A4A49F">
  <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="closebtn">x</span>
  <h2>2020/Present</h2>
  <p>Back to welding I am a team leader on one of the plant's oldest projects, the first project I worked on twelve years ago. I learned some days ago, by myself, how to correct trajectories in the welding robots by trial and error, mostly on Motoman and Fanuc. And four weeks ago (today, as I write, September six), I took my first steps into the technical world of the Internet, thanks to my sister-in-law. We spend every Saturday teaching me new and exciting things that I hope I will put to good use in the future. Besides everything, I'm a father, a companion, a worker, and a curious person who is eager to learn.</p>
