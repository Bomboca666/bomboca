    <h2>Everything Changes</h2>
    <p>The night shift in the benders was fun. We had a great team, and unless we had a huge problem with a machine, we always fulfilled our objectives. There were days that I had time for everything, and others that I could barely breath. I rarely needed maintenance, and learned how to fix most of our problems, and when I had time, I made some changes in the programs to make the benders work faster. In one reference, I've programmed the bender to save nine seconds per part, and it bends four parts per tube, so it's thirty-six seconds per tube. That's a lot by the end of the night. But everything changes, and by the end of two thousand nineteen, I was getting exhausted, both psychologically and physically. It was hard to divide time between being a recent father, managing my team at night, and sleeping by day. So I asked my manager to depromote me to assembler again. I told him to find a team leader for the benders and I will form him there, but I was really exhausted and needed to slow down. So, six months later, I was an assembler again. And out of nowhere, covid, everything blew up. A huge number of assembly lines stopped. A lot of workers were fired, and the ones that remained never worked in the same assembly line for too long. We needed to jump from one line to the other to fulfill the plant's needs. I finally remained in the same assembly line when things started to calm down and became a welder again in the oldest assembly line in the plant. It was fun, but didn't last long. A rumor was spreading through the plant.</p>

    <h2>Back In Euro5</h2>
    <p>Being an assembler was cool. My only responsibility was to send OK parts to our client, and I only had to manage my own machine. But in two thousand and twenty-one, a rumor was circulating in the plant, the Euro5 was returning <i>(part seen above)</i>. That gave me chills. I have a lot of long-term injuries related to that assembly line, but I still cherish that project. So, one day, I arrived at my assembly line to work and my former supervisor was talking to my team leader. When I met them, she told me with an angry face, "You're going to the Euro5". I looked shocked at her, but was thrilled inside. The last time I worked on that assembly line was like six years ago. When I arrived, everything was in disarray. My Euro5 team leader was a former colleague from the old Euro 5. Slowly, we started to make the desired parts for shipping, but it took a while. We worked the entire week, and on Saturday and Sunday we worked twelve hours straight. Even the plant manager was there. It was critical that we make the parts for our client. And we did. Later that week, my manager asked me if I wanted to be a team leader again in Euro 5, but I refused and explained to him my reasons. In July of two thousand and twenty-two, my team leader told me that he had resigned from the plant. I started thinking about accepting my manager's proposal and talked about it with my supervisor. In the last week of my former team leader, I was in training to be a team leader again.<br><b>This is a summary of my life as a worker.</b></br></p>
