    <h2>In the beggining</h2>
    <p>June 6, 2010. I walked my first steps into the industrial world. I was naive as it was the first job that I had, but soon I learned how the industrial world works. It was a time for discovery, to know how everything worked. To be honest, in my first weeks I was scared to even talk to a supervisor because, in my formation, our superiors told us that we had a hierarchy that we needed to follow and that hierarchy was operator->team leader->supervisor->UAP manager->plant manager. I was even afraid to talk to the maintenance team as everything was new to me. But soon I started to get familiar with everything, but had a hard time getting along with people because I had some social issues. Three months after starting at my plant, I asked to move to the night shift, and that's where the real adventure started. On the night shift, we had a team of twelve workers in an assembly line that, at the end of its life, did more parts per shift with just six workers. We built parts mostly for Peugeot and Citroen, and we had a lot of fun. Our team had a lot of competitive spirit, and we always needed to make more parts than the other shifts. To give some perspective, the parts weighed seven kilograms (roughly 15 pounds) and we did four hundred and eighty parts per day. I had three posts, welded three parts in the catalyst, recover parts that had imperfections in the welding (TIG process), and an estanquicity, to make sure that the part was OK for our clients.</p>

    <h2>Last steps in Euro 5</h2>
    <p>We were truly competitive to the point that if a different shift or the sister assembly line did four hundred and eighty-five parts, and the next day we needed to do four hundred and eighty-six parts, just because of the competition that we had. Because of our work on both assembly lines of that project, our manager received a replica of a part made from crystal. We always do our best to fulfill the needs of our clients, and a lot of Saturdays we worked, just having Sunday to rest. The maximum number of Saturdays that I worked in a row was five. At the end, I felt exhausted, but we didn't fail to ship parts to our clients. It was crazy. On the night shift, in the early days, we only worked seven hours a night, and at six in the morning, we'd already finished everything. It was in Euro5 that I developed some injuries too. We pushed ourselves beyond our limits, and sometimes that doesn't work well. By the end of the life of the assembly line, I had some respiratory issues because of the smoke from the welding, and I was transferred to the cold zone of the plant and to the day shift.</p>
