    <h2>First Impressions</h2>
    <p>My first week was awful. There were a bunch of new mechanics and processes, and at first I didn't like the change, but I was transferred for health issues, so I needed to adapt to this new reality. At first, I worked on a bender and a forming (machine that gives shapes to tubes), and with time, I started to like the work, especially the benders. They have a lot more mechanics than a welding robot, and the programming was more accessible because the machine was unlocked, so everyone could change the programs of the designated references. I loved welding, but this was an entirely new universe, and I started to like it. The team leader that I had suffered a bike accident, and I became his substitute. When he recovered and returned, they kept me as a team leader in another shift, and finally I had more spare time to mess with the benders programming, mostly Crippa.</p>

    <h2>Best Years</h2>
    <p>Stress! The amount of stress was unbelievable. We produced parts for every corner of the plant, and shipped parts to other plants internationally. Running from one bender to the next was a typical day. We got along great with the supervisor during that shift. She was very methodical, which was great because it meant I could keep my team organized and make the parts that were needed for the week. But then, my manager asked me if I could form a team leader for the night shift, and I proposed that I move to the night shift and form a team leader during the day. He agreed. And with that, I parted ways with my regular team and returned to the night shift. The night shift is from midnight to 8 AM. I worked 12 hours a day for the next month to form a team leader in one shift and assist the another team leader in the other shift. It was intense and exhausting.</p>
